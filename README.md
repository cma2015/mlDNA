## [Machine Learning–Based Differential Network Analysis: A Study of Stress-Responsive Transcriptomes in **Arabidopsis**](https://github.com/cma2015/mlDNA)

## Introduction

mlDNA is an machine learning (ML) based methodology for transcriptome analysis via comparison of gene coexpression networks. The mlDNA first used a ML-based filtering process to remove nonexpressed, constitutively expressed, or non-stress-responsive “noninformative” genes prior to network construction, through learning the patterns of 32 expression characteristics of known stress-related genes. The retained “informative” genes were subsequently analyzed by [ML](javascript:;)-based network comparison to predict candidate stress-related genes showing expression and network differences between control and stress networks, based on 33 network topological characteristics.
